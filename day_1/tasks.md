## Task2
    - Try to guess the value of: 12 - 4 / 3 * 12 % 3 + 100 - 2 -> 109.0
    - Try to guess the value of: 12 - 12 % 3 * 4 / 3 + 100 - 2 -> 110.0
    - print both of the above "expression" to verify your guess

## Task3
    ### Based on what you understand of conversion
    - Run the code below
    - Read the error message
    - Fix the error using conversion:
